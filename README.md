# Big_Data_Final_project
# This repository contains scripts and data files that process the most recently assembled Human Genome and the assembly of expressed
# transcript sequences available from NCBI: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/guide/human/#download. The files used in this analysis were
# were the Reference Genome Sequence, the RefSeq Reference Genome Annotation, RefSeq Transcripts, and RefSeq Proteins.
# The script in this file gathers sequences and genes from the GIMAP gene family and the ensembl gene ids for genes
# from up to 100kb around it, and lists the locations of all the GIMAP genes in the Human genome in a text file format.
